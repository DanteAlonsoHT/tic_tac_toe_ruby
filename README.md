> This repository is about an example of how to build your own tic tac toe game from scratch using Ruby.

As you can see in this repository, the main idea is to create one of the most popular games in history (**Tic Tac Toe**) using Ruby as the programming language, then the repository is to improve the *OOP* (**Object Oriented Programming**) concepts by making Tic Tac Toe game.

## Game Description
